      <p>The 2016 UT Digital Preservation Symposium (http://conferences.lib.utexas.edu/digipres-2016/), held in the Learning Commons of UT's Perry Castenda Library, featured technology demonstrations, a panel, a drop-in preservation lab, and lightning talks, focusing on intersections and collaboration among those with a stake in preserving digital materials. Librarians, archivists, researchers, IT people, information professionals, faculty, digital humanists, scholars and students were all encouraged to attend and&mdash; even better&mdash; present. The theme was broad enough to accomodate a wide range of topics, which was exactly what the organizers intended. Talks ranged from a high-level overview of information governance to the granular details of an audio preservation project.</p>
      <p>As a member of the UT student SAA chapter, both visibly and vocally engaged in digital archiving, and an IT semi&ndash;pro, I saw the symposium first as something to put on my calendar. After a little encouragement, I decided to present as well. That put me up against a problem: what did I have to tell this crowd, that was relevant, informative, and they didn't already know? To answer that question, I asked people familiar with my work: what would they want to hear me talk about, if they saw my name on the program?</p>
      <p>The answer was surprisingly simple: archivists, and technologists, like <em>use cases</em>; what they wanted to hear from me was how to use digital archives technology, or how to use it better. Since I'd been the <i>de facto</i> administrator for the iSchool's DSpace repository, the most natural fit was something DSpace&ndash;related. Eventually I settled on my topic: how to ingest muliple objects into a single item or collection using the DSpace command line uploading tool. Having seen the GUI uploader, and spoken with colleagues from other departments who'd had to use it for large ingests, I wanted to demonstrate a different way to manage batch ingests and at the same time touch on one of my professional concerns: that information professionals responsible for digital repositories should have access to, and administrator privileges on, the machines which run them.</p>
      <p>Root, in other words. Root privilege on a server is not something to be taken lightly, nor should it be, and it is something which makes an information professional&mdash; be they librarian, archivist, or data manager&mdash; more effective. I gave a talk on when, why, and how to use the batch ingest function in DSpace because I thought it would be informative and useful for those with access to their repository servers, but also because I wanted to start that discussion in that room. The audience which the organizers had attracted&mdash; made up of administrators, IT professsionals, librarians&mdash; was the one I wanted to reach, people who stood to gain significantly from this change in how IT access is managed and were in a position to advocate for change. That afternoon, and on several occasions since, I have been part of discussions about just that: I think that ensuring that library and archives technologists have access to their own tools, as the default an not the exception, is an important issue for the profession.</p>
      <p>It does look a bit like gibberish. And, done right, it really does makes you feel like a wizard. But the batch uploader is just magic words: root is where the power is.</p>
