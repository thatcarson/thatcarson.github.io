		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Much like this page, I'm one of those works still in progress.</p>
		<!--<p>A liberal artist turned information scientist, my primary focus is on digital archives and assets, with a strong emphasis on becoming Batman.

It is still a matter of intense debate whether I'm a lazy slob masquerading as a disciplined individual, or a highly organized person pretending to be a slacker.

Talk about my awards- recipient of the Benonine Muse and David Caldwell Gracy Presidential Scholarhips, DESCRIPTION OF SAME, member of SAA, Social Liason for the UT chapter of ASIS&amp;T/AWIT. One year of working as a systems administrator for the iSchool.

My primary interests are digital archives, research data management, digital humanities, and motorcycles: fortunately for everyone within about eighty miles, graduate school only provides for three of those and has neatly absorbed all of my free time. </p>-->
