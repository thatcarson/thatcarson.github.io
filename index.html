		<h1 id="top">about me</h1>
		<h2>Think like a humanist, talk like an engineer, act like an archivist. And sometimes the other way around.</h2>
		<p>Much like this page, I'm one of those works still in progress.</p>
		<p>As a Liberal Artist turned Information Scientist, I have more camps to stand in than I have feet, but my interests all center on either digital knowledge management or becoming Batman. While the jury is still out on whether I'm a lazy slob masquerading as a disciplined individual or a highly organized person pretending to be a slacker, I am a confirmed dilletant, always trying to learn something new. It all connects, though: from critical design to digital humanities, <i>respect du fonds</i> to systems administration, research data management to digital forensics, everything I have been doing for the past two years has focused on either the work I intend to do, or the tools with which I'll be doing it.</p>
		<p>I see myself as a digital archivist, preserving, maintaining, and facilitating access to materials, making them discoverable by a wide audience. What that entails depends on where I am: I can import and manage assets, design and structure collections, and install and run software. In order to do those things, I've learned hard and soft skills, building a framework on which to grow. I spent a year and a half as a Linux administrator overseeing a digital repository; built a subject taxonomy the content of which nearly made my professor faint; learned how to implement and crosswalk metadata schemas; messed around with scripting languages; interrogated tools as if they were texts; helped people tell me what they wanted to accomplish, and then helped them accomplish it. Iâ€™ve worked with cultural heritage objects, documentary materials, archival technology, and technology which belongs in an archive. What it comes down to is mediating between what people want, what materials allow, and what machines support. I solve problems.</p>
		<p>As an information professional, I think that every institution (public or private) would benefit from having an archivist&mdash; even if they don't know it. And even if they call it something else.</p>
