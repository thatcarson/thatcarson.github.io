    <div class="feature"><h2>Four students. Thirteen banker's boxes. Twelve basketballs. Hundreds of newsletters, photographs, and newspaper clippings.
    Thirty years of UT women's basketball. One semester.</h2>
      <p>Properly named "The UT Womenâ€™s Basketball and Intercollegiate Athletics Collection," these materials
    document the development of women's sports at the University of Texas, driven by the powerhouse that women's basketball became under Coach Conradt, Athletics Director Lopiano, and Sports
    Information Director Plonsky. When we first saw them, piled on shelves in the Stark Center's processing area, the stacks of file folders and bricks of newsprint told a very different story: an office quickly emptied, materials
    stored in a spare room until a home could be found for them. Brent Sipes, our supervisor, and Dr Trace, our instructor, gave us guidance
    and input, but this was our first chance to see if we could apply what we had learned in the classroom, and we were nervous.</p>
      <p>Over the course of the semester, we worked together to process the papers. We rebuilt the original arrangement where we could, and created a meaningful order where we couldn't. We
    put in the long hours that physical arrangement requires, weeding duplicates, counting materials by format, refoldering and reboxing, redacting, preserving, and
    labeling. We talked while we worked, sorting out issues as they arose, setting a processing level and sticking to it (even when it was a pain- like the 227 sleeved and labeled
    photographs). Using training, judgement, and consensus, we navigated the challenges our collection threw at us (and we did think of it as "our" collection), relying on ourselves and each other.
    When, about halfway through the semester, a new box surfaced, we worked on the fly to adapt our arrangement and find where the materials wanted to be, and how we could put them there.</p>
      <p>Each one of us- Nina, Arely, Garret, and I- participated in the intellectual and physcial work equally. As soon as our final arrangement and processing
    plan was approved, we started working on the finding aid, writing and workshopping drafts of the biographical history, the scope and content note, and the abstract. We stayed up
    late editing and rewriting, assembling the container list, and building the structure of the EAD finding aid so that each component would tie together and validate when we
    were done. Every component of the project was collaborative, ensuring that we each got experience with every facet, and along the way, we grew familiar not just with the materials, but
    the stories they told and the people they described.</p>
