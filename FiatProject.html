        <h2>They say that you learn more from failure than you do from success. FIAT was a great teacher.</h2>
        <p>Digital archiving can mean a lot of things- and so can &quot;archival technology.&quot; This project ran the gamut from
        technology used for archival purposes to technology that belongs in an archive and back. Built in 2000, The Dell PowerEdge
        4000 known as &quot;FIAT&quot; had been the backbone server for the School of Information, hosting the school's web infrastructure,
        managing user accounts and namespaces, accessing the UT LDAP directory, and storing credential pairs. During one of the
        school's periodic hardware updates, it had been replaced- mirrored over to a new machine, powered down, and tucked into a
        corner of the server room to be forgotten. After a few years in what amounted to a closet, it came to us via Dr.
        Galloway's Digital Archiving course. Our mission was clear: gain access to the machine, determine what was on it, and
        retrieve the data if possible, documenting the process to assist with later decomissioning projects.</p>
        <p>We managed the first two, and the last one. The third proved to be more difficult. Of the five of us, I was the only one
        with command line, Linux, or server experience, and it was hard to say who was more worried about the project- them, who
        didn't know what to expect, or me, who had an idea. Though my worst fears (trying to rebuild a software RAID from disk images,
        a failed drive) thankfully never materialized, what we did encounter kept us guessing, trying, and- yes- learning.</p>
        <p>The catalog of Things Which Did Not Work is a long one: booting from a Linux live cd; connecting via a write blocker to the
          Digital Archaeology Lab's forensic laptop; directly connecting usb drives; putting the machine on a local network; burning an
          .iso file to disk. If we hadn't encountered the roadblocks we had, however, we never would have known those things were possible,
          much less researched and attempted them. Just as one example, if booting from the cd had worked, we wouldn't have learned
          what single-user mode was, or how to boot a Red Hat machine into it. One after another, the errors the machine reported and
          problems we encountered, while they drove us off the path of recommended best practices, drew us further into the Real World,
          where things go wrong and you have to work around them.</p>
        <p>The project was not a total loss, even outside of the learning experiences. We did gain access to FIAT (if more directly than
          archival practice calls for); we were able to determine when the machine was in use, found the old iSchool website directory,
          even created a backup of the site (though our last-ditch effort to get the data off of the machine was thwarted by a hardware
          problem). Eventually, we ran out of time, but not ideas. Our final report includes a list of suggestions for the next group to
          try recovering data from FIAT.</p>
        <p>While it sometimes felt like Murphy was calling the shots on this project (indeed, that became one of our nicknames for
        the server), I can say with certainty that our group learned more about the strange twists and turns that data recovery and
        technology archiving can take than we would have if everything (or even anything) had gone &quot;right.&quot; We felt confident
        enough in our results to submit the project as a demonstration at the iSchool's Spring Open House, where we wheeled FIAT into a
        conference room to let attendees see- and hear!- the machine for themselves. Talking to the people who stopped by, who were
        involved with or interested in this kind of infrastructure preservation and recovery, it was heartening to hear their own horror
        stories, their consternation and admiration as we recounted the things we'd tried and where we had looked for answers.</p>

        presentation, and digital poster is available <a href="https://ford.ischool.utexas.edu/xmlui/handle/2081/32193" target="blank">on the iSchool's institutional repository</a>.
