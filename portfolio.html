      <b>Summer 2016</b><br />
        <p>The Austin Independent School District has provided public education to the citizens of Austin and Travis County for over a century: its history is documented in its archive, held with the professional library in the Library Media Center and unfortunately underutilized. Funded by a grant, hundreds of photographs, serials, and district publications were digitized: when the grant period ended, however, the project stalled. Though some materials were available online through their Digital Asset Management System, Portfolio, the archive had no entry point.</p>
        <p>The objective of this project was to optimize the digital archive: enhancing discoverability, structuring the archival materials, creating a patron portal, and providing documentation for further work. Through discussions with the LMC staff, I assessed the state of the digital archive, determined best practices for metadata capture, and designed an extensible collection structure to display the materials online. Addressing the differences between the previous metadata format (MARC21) and Dublin Core, I created a database for metadata capture, built corresponding metadata templates in the DAMS, and wrote a usage guide for the cataloger. Working with Portfolio, I structured the display of materials and designed a patron portal, providing multiple access points to the archive&mdash; in finding aid order, digital exhibits, and through subject search links&mdash; and documenting the logic in a design brief. The AISD Archives Online is now structured to provide both casual patrons and experienced researchers with easy access to more than one hundred years of Austin history, and the LMC staff have the tools they need to continue developing and adding to the digital archive.</p>

          I presented a lightning talk with slides, aimed at the digital asset management and preservation community
           demonstrating use cases and commands for using the DSpace batch uploading utility at the command line. Using this utility requires not just access to the server, but root, something to consider.
